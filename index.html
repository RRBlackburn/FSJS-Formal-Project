    <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Life is pretty hectic. Through a myriad of issues with depression and anxiety; I have struggled to find a solid ground to stand on. Putting things in lists helped me to measure my progress and have a hard copy of the game plan when I got off track. 
            <br><br>
        But in my generation we are also bound by technology. I found myself wanting a digital alternative to the traditional paper lists. These are easy to lose and hard to keep up with. Real Life had me in a class training in Web Developement; that's what brought us here today.
            <br><br>
        I fully intend on this eventually developing into an application that will be available on the phone. An attractive but minimalistic alert system to help you organize your life, especially in those hectic moments. There are other ideas to make it more comforting based on what I've felt helps to keep things clear.
            <br><br>
        The design of the web page and the app will be based around calming color theories and minimalistic design principles. With this in mind, I hope to keep things simple. Life is rough, Lists are confusing. The aesthetics of the web shouldn't contribute to that.
